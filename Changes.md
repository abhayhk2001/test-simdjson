## 1. Created Function for fomatting the file with very being appended with a ',' except the last line.
## 2. Added Count to control the number of line being processed.
## 3. Noticed Changes in Data:
Lot more duplicate columns have been added

Timestamp format is now yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z' as a string (easier to handle but will no tbe able to query)

There are three columns that can be indexed : Data_item_name, Data_item_id, Data_item_type. which should be given priority?
